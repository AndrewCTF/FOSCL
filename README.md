# FOSCL – Full Open Source Continuity License

**Pronunciation:** *"FOSS-kul"* (like "fossil" but with a soft **k** sound).

## 🌍 Welcome  

Hi there! 👋  
Thank you for stopping by! This repository exists to introduce and share the **Full Open Source Continuity License (FOSCL)** — a new kind of license that I created because I believe in the true spirit of open source.  

Too often, big corporations find loopholes in licenses, taking advantage of open source work while keeping their own larger projects closed. That didn’t sit right with me. I wanted to make something **fair, strong, and clear**:  
- If you use code under this license, your **entire project must remain open source**.  
- No hidden loopholes, no tricks with “only part of the software.”  
- Even over-the-network use (like servers or cloud services) must remain open source if they use this code.  

This way, the open source community grows stronger together, without one-sided exploitation.

## 📜 What is FOSCL?  

The **FOSCL license**:  
- Guarantees that forks, derivatives, and connected projects also remain open source.  
- Ensures transparency for software delivered over the network.  
- Protects developers by making sure open source contributions are respected.  
- Allows the project owner (you!) to grant **special paid permissions** for closed-source use if you want (see **FOSCL+**).  

It’s like **Copyleft 2.0, but with no escape hatches**.

## 🎯 Why I Made This  

I wrote this license because I’ve seen too many open source projects being **used without giving back**. While communities, hobbyists, and students embrace the spirit of open source, giant corporations sometimes just take advantage of the work and close everything else off.  

That’s not the kind of future I want for open source.  
With **FOSCL**, the goal is to:  
- Keep sharing alive 🌱  
- Make software more open, not less 🔓  
- Give independent developers protection 💪

## 🛠 Who Can Use It?  

- ✅ **Developers** who want to protect their work from being closed off.  
- ✅ **Open source communities** who want to ensure continuity.  
- ✅ **Students & educators** who want fairness and clarity.  
- ✅ **Companies** who are happy to keep their projects open.  
- ⚠️ **Closed-source businesses**: You’ll need a special permission from the project owner (possible with FOSCL+).

## 📚 How to Use  

1. Add the `LICENSE` file (FOSCL) to your repository.  
2. Mention in your `README` that your project uses the **FOSCL License**.  
3. That’s it — your project is protected against being misused by closed-source adopters.

## ❤️ Contributing  

If you’d like to improve the license wording, suggest clarifications, or help adapt it for more projects, **contributions are welcome!**

## 🚀 Final Note  

FOSCL is about **respect, fairness, and continuity**.  
It’s here so that developers like us can share our work without fear of exploitation.  

Let’s keep open source truly open. 💡
